## Summary: 


## Background Infomation:


## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s):

We are going to model the change in Greenlandian Glaciers over time. To do this, we will use the included libraries to develop an animation of glacier coverage over time.

#### Questions:

How does a glacier's position realtive to the equator or north/south pole effect its melting rate?

How much does recent human caused climate change and global warming effect the rate of glacier melt?

How has the distribution of glaciers in Greenland changed in the recent past (~40 years)?

#### Anaylze the specifics of the greenland glacier:

loss of mass/year

displacement/year

#### Objectives:

Cleanly organize the different datasets into individual dataframes

Convert any necessary columns to Numpy np.ndarrays if vector math is needed

Use Matplotlib to create simple plots of our data

Use Folium to create a heatmap of glacier presence in Greenland over time

## Datasets you will use (with links, if available):

These datasets from the NSIDC. The data set IDs are NSIDC-0625, NSIDC-0788, and RDWES1B
- https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0625/versions/1
- https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0788/versions/1
- https://nsidc.org/data/rdwes1b/versions/1
  
## Tools/packages youâ€™ll use (with links):
Numpy (https://numpy.org/)

Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)

Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)

Xarray (https://pypi.org/project/xarray/)

Cartopy (https://pypi.org/project/Cartopy/)

## Planned methodology/approach:
We will use Matplotlib to create simple plots of our data and then use these plots to help in the creation of a heatmap over time. We will use Folium to display coverage of the Greenland Ice Sheet at each of the times we will analyze. We will animate the coverage of the ice sheet to show change over time. We will also compare these images to quantitatively describe the change in the ice sheet over time.
