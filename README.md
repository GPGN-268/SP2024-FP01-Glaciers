## Summary: 


## Background Infomation:


## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s):
We are going to model the change in Greenlandian Glaciers over time. To do this, we will use the included libraries to develop an animation of glacier coverage over time.

Has the rate of decreasing glacier mass changed over the past 20,40,100 years?
How does a glaciers position realtive to the equator or north/south pole effect its melting rate?
How much does recent human caused climate change and global warming effect the rate of glacier melt?

Anaylze the specifics of the greenland glacier:
loss of mass/year
displacement/year

Objectives:
Cleanly organize the csv file into numpy arrays
Use numpy arrays to create graphs describing the data through different lenses
Use matplotlib to do so
